Here is a project that uses a combination of interfaces. It is a Cabbage/VST plugin that communicates with Python via OSC. Python runs as a separate process in the background. The plugin is an "interval vector harmonizer", where incoming midi notes are harmonized using a dynamic chord structure based on interval vectors. You can record new interval vectors, just play a chord on a channel where recording is enabled. Enable "playback" to make it harmonize notes on that channel. It is possible to enable both record and playback at the same time, but I think it is usually more useful to do one a a time. First record and then just harmonize.
The plugin does not make any sound, so must be connected to another synthesizer plugin (midi in).

Compile the plugin with Cabbage (the csd file osc_vectorHarmonizer.csd)
Load the plugin on a midi track, and start the Python process in a terminal window (python osc_vectorHarmonizer.py)
Requires osc4py3 (https://pypi.org/project/osc4py3/)

The Python code is a mess, sorry about that... :-)
