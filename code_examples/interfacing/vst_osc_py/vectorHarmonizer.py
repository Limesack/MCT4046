    Vector harmonizer

    A simple harmonizer, choosing chord alternatives from an interval vector.
    Voice rules control the selection of the next chord and it's voicing.
    The module takes (note number) and (chord structure) as input,

    Takes a note and an intervalVector, outputs the note and a voiced chord.
    Assumes knowledge of the previous chord (melody + harmonizing notes).
    The note is harmonized according to the following voice leading rules:
        1. Use shortest possible path for voice leading
        2. Use common tones if possible
        3. Avoid parallel motion simultaneously in all voices
        4. Choose chord spread (tightly spaced or spread out)
        5. Avoid repeating the exact same chord if possible
        6. Avoid going back to the second previous chord if possible
        7. If a note in the chord is outside the voice range, give it a penalty score
        8. If the previous chord contained out of range notes, and the next chord will move even further out of range, give it an extra penalty.

    A number of alternatives for "next chord" is created using the interval vector,
    each of these alternatives is given a score according to the rules stated above.
    The alternative with the *lowest* score is chosen as the harmonizing chord
